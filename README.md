## Quicksort Pivot Imbalance

What if, instead of choosing the "optimal" pivot (i.e. the median),
you were to knowingly choose a sub-optimal pivot in quicksort?

The answer lies in the depths of the CPU, more specifically, in its
branch prediction unit. If the pivot is the median, then there is
a 50% chance that the next element will belong to the left side of
the partition and a 50% chance that it will go right. In other words,
the branch prediction will be wrong half of the time and will have
to flush the pipeline.

If, on the other hand, we choose the pivot so that only a quarter
of all elements will be on the left side of the partition, then
the CPU could guess "right" all the time and it would be right 75%
of the time, resulting in a significantly reduced number of branch
misses.

To show that this can, in fact, be faster, we use a completely
artificial "benchmark"â€”sorting a random permutation of the integers
0 to n-1. The input size n is specified as the first parameter, the
skew parameter as the second.

- 0 will do nothing (useful to measure initialization time)
- 1 will use `std::sort`
- s>1 will partition 1/s-th of the elements to the left and the other (s-1)/s-th elements to the right

Thus, a skew of 2 means equal partioning, 3 means 1/3rd left and 2/3rds right, etc.

On my machine (Haswell Core-i7 4790T), it seems out that s=7 yields
the fastest running times. The detailed measurements are available
in [time.pdf](time.pdf) for skew between 2 and 12 as well
as `std::sort` (all times are averaged over 10 iterations).

All of this is not to say that we should suddenly
use suboptimal pivot choices. Instead, it might be worth striving for
branch-avoiding sorting algorithms where they are appropriate. This is
the rationale behind *Super Scalar Sample Sort* [1], which makes only
a constant number of *hard-to-predict branches*.

(This issue has been previously studied on the Prescott architecture in [2],
where due to the much longer pipeline (31 steps!), a skew of 11 proved optimal.
Nowadays, the pipeline comprises 14-19 steps, which explains the lower skew.)
